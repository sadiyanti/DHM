# DHM
 
The executable files of the hydrological model and dataset for the calibration and validation used to create Figure 5 of the manuscript "Using Inverse Modelling and Dual Isotopes (δ15N and δ18O of NO3) to Determine Sources of Nitrogen Export from a Complex Land Use Catchment" submitted for publication at the AGU Journal Water Resources Reserch. 

For this study, an improved Distributed Hydrological Model (DHM) originally developed by Hydrology and Water Resources Laboratory, Kyoto University (HYWR Lab.,
http://hywr.kuciv.kyoto-u.ac.jp/products/1K-DHM/1K-DHM.html) was utilised. DHM original sources can be accessed from HYWR Lab. 

We share the exe file which was compiled by GNU compiler in Linux.

Model calibration setup in folder Fig 5a-e can be execut usied using "sceua". 
Model validation setup in folder Fig 5f can be executed using "1k-dhm.out", and ascii data can be obtained from "pointdata-daily.out".
