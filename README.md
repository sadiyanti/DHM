# DHM
 
The executable files of the hydrological model and dataset for the calibration and validation used to create Figure 5Th Using Inverse Modelling and Dual Isotopes (δ15N and δ18O of NO3) to Determine Sources of Nitrogen Export from a Complex Land Use Catchment.
For this study, we improved a Distributed Hydrological Model that was originally developed by Hydrology and Water Resources Laboratory, Kyoto University (HYWR Lab.,
http://hywr.kuciv.kyoto-u.ac.jp/products/1K-DHM/1K-DHM.html). DHM original sources can be accessed from HYWR Lab. 

We share the exe file which was compiled by GNU compiler in Linux.
DHM originally source codes and documents are provided from the website of HYWR Lab.

Fig 5a-e can be calibrated using "sceua".
Fig 5f can be calculated use "1k-dhm.out", and then ascii data can be obtained by "pointdata-daily.out".
